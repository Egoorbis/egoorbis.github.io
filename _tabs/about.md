Hey, I'm Reto and welcome to my blog!

For those who know me well, you’ve probably heard me talk about starting a blog for years. Well, I’ve finally done it and published my first short post. Writing has always been something I’ve wanted to do, and I’m thrilled to share my insights with you.

On this blog, I write about what interests me the most: Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Engineering, with a particular focus on Microsoft Azure. Whether you’re a fellow tech enthusiast, a professional in the field, or just curious about the cloud, I hope you’ll find my posts informative and engaging.

Feel free to hold me accountable and encourage me to keep writing if you enjoy what you read. Thank you for stopping by and joining me on this journey. Here’s to many more posts and exciting discussions!

Happy reading!

Reto
